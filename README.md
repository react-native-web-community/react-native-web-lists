# react-native-web-lists
> React Native for Web implementation of Lists

**DEPRECATED: `react-native-web` now support FlatList, this package is now useless.**

This package uses the legacy implementation (ListView).

## Getting started
`$ npm install react-native-web-lists --save`


## Usage
Note: This implementation will work on Android and iOS because in `index.native.js` the default classes are exported from `react-native`

```js
import { FlatList } from 'react-native-web-lists'; // don't import from react-native
import { SectionList } from 'react-native-web-lists'; // don't import from react-native
```

See [RN's docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist.html).

## Examples
See the [storybook](https://react-native-web-community.github.io/react-native-web-lists/storybook).
